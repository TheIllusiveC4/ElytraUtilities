Elytra Utilities is a lightweight client-side only mod that features small but useful quality of life and accessibility
improvements for Elytra flight.

**This mod is client-side only.**

None of the features of this mod give players any extra abilities or gameplay advantages over vanilla Minecraft.

## Features

![Elytra Utilities Controls](https://i.ibb.co/2hG9pqb/elytrautilitieskeys.png)

### Toggle Elytra Flight

By setting a keybinding (default: none), players can use it to disable and enable Elytra flight. When disabled, a small
broken Elytra icon will render in the top-left corner of the screen to indicate that flight is disabled. While disabled,
players will not be able to start flying with elytras. This is useful for players who may have times when they want the
freedom to move and jump as they please without worrying about accidentally triggering the Elytra flight on falls.

### Trigger Elytra Flight

By setting a keybinding (default: none), players can automatically trigger Elytra flight. Instead of needing to do a
timed double jump in order to activate an Elytra from the ground, players can instead begin flying with a single press
of a button. This makes flying more accessible for players who may have trouble with the default controls or simply
prefer an alternative method.

### Simple Fireworks Takeoff

When using the **Trigger Elytra Flight** feature, players can optionally long-press the bound button for at least half a second
while holding at least one Firework Rocket. This will automatically make the player use the rocket. The benefit of this
feature is that the complicated control sequence of doing a double jump to activate the Elytra and then using a rocket
to takeoff can be condensed into a single long-press of a button.

Note that this feature will only work on the initial takeoff. Further uses of the Firework Rocket to maintain momentum
or altitude need to use the regular controls.
